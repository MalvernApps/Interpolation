This ia C# example of how to do Quadratic interpolation.

I keep having to rewrite this code and reprove if from first principles so this is an effort never to forget it again and to code it in C#. 

All you need is the function call in your code.

Adssume you have an array

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
